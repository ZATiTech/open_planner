# open_planner
Integrated open source planner and related tools for autonomous navigation of autonomous vehicle and mobile robots

## Note: 
I found several issues related to the Autoware requirements such as:

- Sensing topics frequency
- LIDAR data format and driver output.
- Which version from Autoware is stable to work with the bridge.

Fix is on the way. 

Found the working release , check the read me in [op_carla_bridge](https://github.com/ZATiTech/open_planner/tree/humble/op_carla_bridge)
